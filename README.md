Spotify Clone Project
I created this Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to replicate the core features of the popular music streaming platform. 
This project includes essential functionalities like a user-friendly interface for browsing 
and playing songs, a fully responsive layout, custom playlists, and a functional audio player 
with play, pause, and skip controls. The styling was crafted with CSS, ensuring an appealing design across different 
screen sizes, while JavaScript powers the interactivity and audio control logic.

Special thanks to CodeWithHarry for his amazing free web development course.
His tutorials provided a strong foundation in web development and helped me build this project.
I highly recommend his course to anyone looking to start their journey into coding!

TIPS:
Inside songs folder paste more than 2 song in each of its folder in it to make the interface work properly.

WORKING:
The songs are directly uploaded to the web when they are pasted in every folder of song folder . 
This happens due to tha use of innerhtml in the javascript which takes the song folder as a html code .
